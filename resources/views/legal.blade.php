<li class=" w-3/4  leading-normal  m-auto leading-tight mb-4 text-grey-darker text-xl font-termina-l"  >Dispute Resolution for Commercial Entities  <br>If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you and Clout agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be the state and federal courts located in Lagos State and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. </li>



<li class=" w-3/4  leading-normal  m-auto leading-tight mb-4 text-grey-darker text-xl font-termina-l"  >Dispute Resolution for Consumers  <br> <ol style="list-style: lower-roman;"> <br> <li class="mb-2">Agreement to Arbitrate <br><br>
You and Clout agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Clout with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide Clout with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Clout with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in Lagos State and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Further, unless both you and Clout otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
</li>

<br>

<li class="mb-2 mt-2">Arbitration Rules<br><br>
The arbitration will be resolved amicably through mediation by both parties. Otherwise, such dispute shall be referred to Arbitration at the Lagos Multi-Door Court House pursuant to the Lagos State Multi Door Court House Law 2007. 
</li>


<br>

<li class="mb-2 mt-2">Arbitration Decision<br><br>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the Lagos State Multi-Door Courthouse Rules, 2007. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. 
</li>

<br>

<li class="mb-2 mt-2">Changes<br><br>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if Clout changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to  <a style="text-decoration: underline;" target="new" href="">studio@clout.ng</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Clout’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Clout in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

<h1 class="  font-termina-m py-2 text-center mb-4 mt-4">General Terms</h1>


<ol style="    list-style: disc;">
<p class=" w-3/4  leading-normal  m-auto leading-tight mb-2 text-grey-darker text-xl font-termina-l text-center" >These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Clout and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Clout and you regarding the Services and Content.
If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Dispute Resolution for Consumers” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, if you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity or if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Clout’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Clout may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
Any notices or other communications provided by Clout under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
Clout’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Clout. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
